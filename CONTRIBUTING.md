## Code

- **The Main-class:** The Main-class of ServerPackCreator should never contain any code which does actual work on the server pack itself. It is supposed to be the anchor-point from wich all calls to the rest of the program are made. This let's us coders keep a better overview over when what happens where. So, if you were to add support for, say, another modloader, Main would never see any changes to it's code, but rather ServerSetup or any other class, depending on what your changes do.

- **Config file:** If you want to contribute to SPC, please make sure you do not change the `serverpackcreator.conf`-file. Ideally, any version of SPC will work with any config file, as they all have the same content. Chaning what's inside the `serverpackcreator.conf`-file would make versions incompatible to each other, but I want users to be able to simply download the newest version **without** having to migrate their config file or even worrying about such a thing.
Therefor, I ask that you do not touch the `serverpackcreator.conf`-file.
  
- **Variable names:** Please keep variable names verbose i.e. `thisStoresSomething` or `checkForStuff` or some such. Variables like `a` and `tmpA` make code harder to read. We're not aiming for best performance or whatever, so we can have longer variable names if we want to.

- **Files:** If your changes introduce additional files to the ecosystem of ServerPackCreator, please define them in `Reference.java`. I reserve the right to reject PRs which introduce additional files to ServerPackCreator, depending on what they are for.

- **Visibility:** Because the files generated by this program are supposed to be distributed to multiple people, I try to keep methods and classes as closed-off as possible. It's not much, but it's something. Therefor, unless your method or class *absolutely* must be public, keep it package private or make it private completely. I reserve the right to refactor any such classes or methods.  

## Commits

If you want to contribute to SPC, please make sure your commits follow the conventional commit layout and use the types/categories/flags described here: [actions/auto-changelog](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/auto-changelog)

For completeness' sake:

```git
type(category): description [flag]
```

The `type` must be one of the followings:

* `breaking` (Breaking Changes)
* `build` (Build System / Dependencies)
* `ci` (Continuous Integration)
* `chore` (Chores)
* `docs` (Documentation Changes)
* `feat` (New Features)
* `fix` (Bug Fixes)
* `other` (Other Changes)
* `perf` (Performance Improvements)
* `refactor` (Refactors)
* `revert` (Reverts)
* `style` (Code Style Changes)
* `test` (Tests)

> If the `type` is not found in the list, it'll be considered as `other`.

The `category` is optional and can be anything of your choice.

The `flag` is optional (if provided, it must be surrounded in square brackets) and can be one of the followings:

* `ignore` (Omits the commit from the changelog)
