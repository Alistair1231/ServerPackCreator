**ServerPackCreator is a Java-program which creates a server pack from any given Forge, Fabric, Quilt or LegacyFabric modpack. Customize the
configuration to your liking and off you go.**
**Whenever you are working on an update to your modpack, you simply run ServerPackCreator and BAM! You've got yourself a
server pack for your new modpack version.**

ServerPackCreator is a passion project on which I am working in my spare time. It is also the main reason for why I got into programming in the first place.

I started getting into Java programming in february 2021, when I was working on an update for one of my Minecraft modpacks,
Survive Create Prosper 4, and got tired and bored with manually creating a server pack everytime I wanted to update and
test something, or just release a new server pack for the new modpack version.

The thought "*There must be a way to automate this, or at least make it less tedious...*" was the spark which sent me off
into the world of programming.

And here we are.

**Required:** Please be aware that ServerPackCreator requires a working internet connection in order to work.

**Note:** For more detailed information about all the different configuration options and possibilities of ServerPackCreator, take a look at the [Wiki](https://wiki.griefed.de/en/Documentation/ServerPackCreator/ServerPackCreator-Help)

# Advantages/Disadvantages of CLI, GUI and Webservice:

Each way of using ServerPackCreator has its advantages and disadvantages. Depending on your environment, it may be better to use one way over the other. This section highlights some of the
advantages and disadvantages of each version to help you decide which way you are going to use.
Note: All three ways are supported by the **.jar**-file. Which one is started depends on the CLI arguments used and your environment.

## CLI:

| Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                              | Disadvantages                                                                                                         |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No need for a graphical environment. Can be used on a server to generate a server pack for immediate use.                                                                                               | Gathering of information for a configuration file is tedious.                                                         |
| Step-by-Step generation of a configuration-file with the use of the `-cgen` argument. Generated config will be used immediately afterwards.                                                             | No convenience features file folder-browsing or jumping to the generated server pack after generation.                |
| Load and edit an existing configuration. Editing is limited to base values of a given configuration. Not editable via CLI are script settings as well as any potentially installed addon configuration. | Debugging in case of a broken/erroring configuration file can be time consuming. Careful reading of logs is required. |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Manual editing of the configuration-file in case you want to change it.                                               |

## GUI:

| Advantages                                                                                                             | Disadvantages                     |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Browse the filesystem for folders and file required by the configuration.                                              | Requires a graphical environment. |
| Setting up a configuration by browsing the filesystem and selecting your Minecraft and modloader versions from a list. |                                   |
| Browsing the generated server pack after generation has finished.                                                      |                                   |
| Loading and saving different configurations for quick generation of multiple server packs in short succession.         |                                   |
| Edit the configuration in the GUI. No manual file-editing required.                                                    |                                   |

- A wiki article containing useful hints, tips & tricks about, for and with ServerPackCreator can be found on [my Wiki's ServerPackCreator Help page](https://wiki.griefed.de/en/Documentation/ServerPackCreator/ServerPackCreator-Help)

# 2. Small feature overview

1. Exclude clientside-only mods
    1. Either automatically by letting ServerPackCreator scan the mods of your modpack for their sideness
    2. Manually by configuring a list mods which ServerPackCreator will filter out according to your input. There are four different filter-types at your disposal by which to filter your clientside-only mods.
2. Include files and directories in your server pack. These can be files or folders from your modpack, but also modpack-external files and folders, from your computer!
3. Create your server pack with a server icon. Server icons are automatically scaled down, or up, to 64x64!
4. Create your server pack with a server.properties. Already have a properties-file somewhere you want to use with your new server packs? Tell ServerPackCreator to include it, and off you go! A pre-made server.properties is also a nice way of making sure your server pack users have the correct world-type, difficulty etc. set up already!
5. ServerPackCreator supports the following modloaders: **Forge, Fabric, LegacyFabric and Quilt**
6. If you so desire, you can use Minecraft snapshots and pre-releases, too! Fabric has a habit of supporting the occasional snapshot and/or pre-release.
7. You can let ServerPackCreator install the server for your server pack, so you can run it immediately after generation finished!
8. You can let ServerPackCreator generate a ZIP-archive of the generated server pack, for immediate upload to places like CurseForge (**after** you've tested your server pack, of course 😉)
9. Set commandline arguments with which to start the Minecraft server. Does your modpack require a lot of RAM? Well, tell ServerPackCreator to create the start scripts with `-Xms8G -Xmx8G` or similar values!
    1. Aikars flags are available, too. If you like 'em, use 'em.
10. Don't like the default start scripts ServerPackCreator offers? Create your own and tell ServerPackCreator to use them!
    1. You can configure placeholders and correlating values on a per-server pack-basis. If your custom start script templates contain, for example the placeholder `SPC_FLYNN_LIVES_SPC`, tell ServerPackCreator to replace any occurance of that placeholder with `Now that's a big door`. Voila! Every start script created with that server pack configuration will replace `SPC_FLYNN_LIVES_SPC` with `Now that's a big door` whenever you create a server pack. Other server pack configuration may contain other values for that placeholder. Knock yourself out!

# 3 Java

ServerPackCreator is being developed with Java 8, ServerPackCreator is guaranteed to work with that version.

Users have reported the following Java versions to also work with ServerPackCreator. A list of these can be found at the [Wiki help section](https://wiki.griefed.de/en/Documentation/ServerPackCreator/ServerPackCreator-Help)

**ATTENTION:** I **can** not and **will** not guarantee that ServerPackCreator will work flawlessly with any other Java
version other than version 8. Things may break at **random**, at **any** place, if a **different** Java version is used.
You are welcome to try and use any other version, but do **not** report issues back to me if you do encounter problems
when running ServerPackCreator with a more recent Java version.

# 4. Addons

## 4.1 Why

There are things which people want to do with their server packs which could most certainly be automated. Some of those
things so special, or maybe out of place, that they would not warrant a separate feature for ServerPackCreator itself.
In short: Some things are out of scope for me to add to ServerPackCreator.

It may also be that it is such a niche feature, that I either don't have the time to code it in, or simply don't want to.
Maybe it doesn't fit into the overall design of ServerPackCreator, too. Who knows, it could be any of those reasons or another.

**Hence, the addon functionality!**

This allows people to write their own addons to expand the functionality of ServerPackCreator with their own features as
they see fit or want.

For an example of an addon, see the [ServerPackCreator Example Addon](https://github.com/Griefed/ServerPackCreatorExampleAddon)

## 4.2 Adding your own

A curated list of officially acknowledged addons/plugins can be found at [addons.griefed.de](https://addons.griefed.de) (redirects to [GitHub Pages](https://griefed.github.io/ServerPackCreator-Addons-Overview/#/))

How to get your own addon into this list:

If you have written your own addon or plugin for ServerPackCreator and you would like to see it added here, please open an issue over at ServerPackCreator on GitHub, using the Documentation template.

For an addon to be accepted, you must at least provide:
- The name of the repository, and therefore the addon.
- The owner of the repository, and therefore the addon.
- The branch of the repository where the main code resides in.
- A description of the addon.

# 5. Running

In every situation, the `.jar`-file needs to be run from the commandline. Executing it via "Open with..." and selecting Java will not work. To use the GUI, for example, simply run `java -jar ServerPackCreator-2.x.x.jar`.
The `.exe` can be executed as usual by simply double-clicking it and is GUI exclusive. It only works in Windows, though. Please keep that in mind.

There are a couple of arguments which may or may not be helpful for you, depending on how you plan on using ServerPackCreator:

| Argument  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-help`   | Print ServerPackCreators help to commandline.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `-update` | Check whether a newer version of ServerPackCreator is available.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `-cgen`   | Run ServerPackCreators configuration generation.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `-cli`    | Run ServerPackCreator in commandline-mode. If **no** graphical environment is supported, this is the default ServerPackCreator will enter, even when starting ServerPackCreator with no extra arguments at all.         |
| `-web`    | Run ServerPackCreator as a webservice.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `-gui`    | Run ServerPackCreator with our GUI. If a graphical environment is supported, this is the default ServerPackCreator will enter, even when starting ServerPackCreator with no extra arguments at all.                     |
| `--setup` | Set up and prepare the environment for subsequent runs of ServerPackCreator. This will create/copy all files needed for ServerPackCreator to function properly from inside its JAR-file and setup everything else, too. |

## 6.1 Localization

If you wish to run ServerPackCreator with your locale (if it is already supported), you can either:
1. Run `java -jar ServerPackCreator-X.X.X.jar -lang your_locale` for example `java -jar ServerPackCreator-X.X.X.jar -lang en_us`. This will create the lang.properties-file with your specified locale.
2. Running `java -jar ServerPackCreator-x.x.x.jar` without `-lang en_us` or any other language will set the locale to en_us by default and create the lang.properties-file.
3. Modify the `serverpackcreator.properties`-file in the same directory as ServerPackCreator-X-X-X.jar and set your locale like this `lang=your_locale` for example `lang=en_us`

## 6.2 Using ServerPackCreator

**Read [contributions](https://github.com/Griefed/ServerPackCreator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before considering contributing to ServerPackCreator.**

A short excerpt:

> If you want to contribute to ServerPackCreator, then the following procedure **must** be adhered to:
>
> 1. Fork ServerPackCreator
> 2. Create a new branch in your fork, following one of the following naming schemes:
>     1. The end of each branch name bust be suffixed with a one-word description fitting the changes made. Examples:
>         - griefed_chore_readme
>         - griefed_perf_curseforgemodpack
>         - griefed_feat_ziparchive
>     2. For more details on what the naming scheme entails, see `.releaserc.yml` in the base directory of the repository or scroll down to the **Commits**-section.
>     3. Schemes:
>         1. your_username_breaking_
>         2. your_username_build_
>         3. your_username_chore_
>         4. your_username_ci_
>         5. your_username_docs_
>         6. your_username_feat_
>         7. your_username_fix_
>         8. your_username_perf_
>         9. your_username_refactor_
>         10. your_username_revert_
>         11. your_username_style_
>         12. your_username_test_
>         13. your_username_other_
> 3. Make your changes to your new branch:
>     1. Try to keep the changes atomic, so they best fit the name of the branch.
>     2. Follow conventional commit messages. See **Commits**-section for more details. Example:
>         - feat: Allow upload of modpack-export zip-archive to web-frontend
>         - refactor: Use apache commons-io for copying, instead of Files
> 4. Open an issue on the main repository, using the **Pull Request** template:
>     1. Issue title: Your Username - Branch type (e.g. feat) - Short description of your changes. Example:
>         - Griefed - feat - Allow upload of modpack-export zip-archive to web-frontend
>     2. Issue description: Fill in the sections the template provide.
>     3. Submit the new issue
> 5. I will then create a new branch in the main repository, with the same name as your branch, to which you will **then** create a pull request to.
> 6. If checks and tests pass, or any changes necessary have been made, the pull request is ready to be merged etc., I will merge it to your main repository branch.
> 7. I can then merge your main repository branch into main/master/whatever locally, push these changes to my GitLab instance, which will in turn push these changes to GitHub.
> 8. Done!
>
> This is the only way to ensure that any changes made to ServerPackCreator always arrive on my GitLab instance first, then on GitHub.
> Since I want to stay independent of GitHub and their architecture, I have to make use of my own GitLab installation. Hence this procedure. So, if one day, GitHub vanishes, we still can provide people with ServerPackCreator from my GitLab instance.


# 8. Building ServerPackCreator locally
