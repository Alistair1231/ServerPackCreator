/**
 * The utilities package holds classes and methods for various useful bits and pieces used all
 * throughout ServerPackCreator. If any given method is helpful in multiple steps throughout the
 * ServerPackCreator architecture, it usually belongs to one of the utility classes. <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <p>Such utilities include, but are not limited to converting Strings to booleans, encapsulating
 * each entry in a String List with quotation-marks, downloading files, copying files and folders
 * from a JAR-file and so on and so forth.<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <p>Basically, whenever a method in any SeverPackCreator class becomes useful to multiple classes,
 * it is usually moved into any already existing utility-class or a new one is added if no
 * already-fitting one exists.
