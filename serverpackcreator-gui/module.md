# Module serverpackcreator-gui

# Package de.serverpackcreator.gui

The Swing-GUI for ServerPackCreator. The GUI itself holds little to no actual ServerPackCreator
logic, but instead focuses on accessing the underlying logic to allow a user to configure and
generate a server pack. This package creates the complete GUI which can then be used by a given
user.
